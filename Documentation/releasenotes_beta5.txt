friss Ver. 0.5 (you can call it "Beta 5" or "RC5" if you like)


I need feedback on bugs, crashs and feeds that do not work so that I can fix it. Please send reports!


Supported feed types:
	- rdf:RDF (the XML-Version)
	- rss version="2.00"
	- rss version="2.0"
	- rss version="1.0"
	- rss version="0.91"
	- ATOM
	and maybe more

Partially supported (experimental)
	- iCal/Sunbird ICS calendar files

Not supported:
	- any non-XML rdf-version


Supported encodings:
	- iso-8859-*
	- EUC-JP, Shift_JIS
	- windows-1252


Known Issues:
	- background color does not change immediately after a workspace change.
	- the format of the settings file has changed. Friss will not convert the file but
		start with defaults until it is closed. It will then create a new XML settings file.
	- Preferences: drag and drop isn't good yet
	- The Dragger and its surrounding space don't get redrawn properly.
	- There are still some charsets left which are not supported yet.
	- For certain charsets (e.g. EUC-JP) to take affect, your default font needs to support it too.
	- For Color Auto-Adapt to work properly, you have to set the desktop background
		color to something matching your background image. Friss cannot check
		your image and decide for itself.
	- text color for the textview (like for Fortune) is not updated correctly.
	- If you use the Backgrounds preflet, the color will not auto-adapt. You will have
		to enter Preferences and click on the one of the adapt-radiobuttons to
		make it work. I haven't found a "good" way to check for background/color
		changes.
	- Zeta: Possibly some more compatibility issues I cannot even think of.
	- Replicant mode: Preferences Window will block Tracker.


Tips&Tricks for those who bother to read this file:
	- use a middle button click to advance one feed	
	- see example_feeds/ on how to display the output of fortune, php or other programmes.

Please contact me for feature requests and bug reports:

	Please send screenshots if it's hard to explain what's wrong.

	Und natürlich freue ich mich auch über Mails auf deutsch ;-)
