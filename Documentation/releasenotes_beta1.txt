FRISS DOCUMENTATION

friss Ver. beta1

This version is considered unstable. I need feedback on reproduceable crashs.
I am not responsible for any problems caused by a crashed Tracker. Don't say
I did not warn you ;-)

Known Issues:
	- BeOS R5: displays a color matrix instead of sliders
		Workaround: Update to R5.0.3
	- BeOS R5: shows "Could not open Browser" despite it was opened correctly
		Workaround: Update to R5.0.3
	- Not supported feeds:
		- Heise Newsticker. Their server seems not like the http-request or whatever.
		Will be fixed eventually cause I like their site.
		- ZetaJournal (???) RSS. Not using standard rss elements, but they offer rdf
		aswell so take that instead.
