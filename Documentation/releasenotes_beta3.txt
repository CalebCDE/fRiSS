FRISS DOCUMENTATION

friss Ver. beta3

This version is considered  "not very stable". I need feedback on bugs, crashs and
feeds that do not work so that I can fix it. Please send reports!

I am not responsible for any problems caused by a crashed Tracker. Don't say
I did not warn you ;-)  In case of problems, don't run friss as replicant and/or get
ProcessController from bebits. It's a great tool by the way.


Known Issues:
	- For Color Auto-Adapt to work properly, you have to set the desktop background
		color to something matching your background image. Friss cannot check
		your image and decide for itself.
	- text color for the textview (like for Fortune) is not updated correctly.
	- If you use the Backgrounds preflet, the color will not auto-adapt. You will have
		to enter Preferences and click on the one of the adapt-radiobuttons to
		make it work. I haven't found a "good" way to check for background/color
		changes.
	- The pseudo-categories suck. They will be replaced with real ones. Promised!
	- Occasional crash after adding a new feed.
	- BeOS R5: displays a color matrix instead of sliders
		Workaround: Update to R5.0.3
	- BeOS R5: shows "Could not open Browser" despite it was opened correctly
		Workaround: Update to R5.0.3
	- Zeta: Possibly some more compatibility issues I cannot even think of.

Not supported feeds:
