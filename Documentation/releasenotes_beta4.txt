FRISS DOCUMENTATION

friss Ver. beta4

This version is considered  "pretty stable". I need feedback on bugs, crashs and
feeds that do not work so that I can fix it. Please send reports!

I am not responsible for any problems caused by a crashed Tracker. Even though
crashes rarely or never happen, just be warned. Don't sayI did not warn you ;-)
In case of problems, don't run friss as replicant and/or get ProcessController from
bebits. It's a great tool by the way.

Supported feed types:
	- rdf:RDF (the XML-Version)
	- rss version="2.00"
	- rss version="2.0"
	- rss version="0.91"
	and maybe more

Not supported:
	- any non-XML rdf-version
	- ATOM

Known Issues:
	- The Dragger and its surrounding space don't get redrawn properly.
	- There are still some charsets left which are not supported yet.
	- For certain charsets (e.g. EUC-JP) to take affect, your font needs to support it too.
	- For Color Auto-Adapt to work properly, you have to set the desktop background
		color to something matching your background image. Friss cannot check
		your image and decide for itself.
	- text color for the textview (like for Fortune) is not updated correctly.
	- If you use the Backgrounds preflet, the color will not auto-adapt. You will have
		to enter Preferences and click on the one of the adapt-radiobuttons to
		make it work. I haven't found a "good" way to check for background/color
		changes.
	- The pseudo-categories suck. They will be replaced with real ones. Promised!
	- Occasional crash after adding a new feed.
	- BeOS R5: displays a color matrix instead of sliders
		Workaround: Update to R5.0.3
	- BeOS R5: shows "Could not open Browser" despite it was opened correctly
		Workaround: Update to R5.0.3
	- Zeta: Possibly some more compatibility issues I cannot even think of.
	- Replicant mode: Preferences Window will block Tracker.
	and maybe some more, but right now I'm too lazy to look them up ;-)

Not supported feeds:
	- bezip.de			server does not reply.
	- TBJ RSS-feed		use rdf instead

Please contact me for feature requests and bug reports:
	beos@herzig-net.de
	Please send screenshots if it's hard to explain what's wrong.
	And also send links to feeds that don't work.
	But you can also send a mail just to say that you like my program. I especially
	prefer those mails over bugreports :-)
