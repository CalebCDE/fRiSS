      <title><![CDATA[BeBook XML work]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[I've been doing some work on creating a script to do the majority of the work to transform the BeBook into XML. The work is so far making progress but the BeBook HTML and the scope of topics covered by the BeBook is making it slow going.

The change to Docbook Lite has helped and the stylesheets they distribute as default are useful starting points. While there is some code in the subversion repository the current "state of the art" isn't there yet as it's not working as well as I'd like. I'll commit as soon as it works for the basic test cases I've been looking at.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Packager News]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[Work has progressed on the packager app and it's slowly taking shape. There are now a number of packages that can be installed, though these are simple and the complicated pieces such as dependancies and upgrading aren't there yet. There is also a preflet for controlling your preferences and the start of a PackageBuilder (think in terms of acorn to oak tree).

Also under development has been libpeople though at some point I think this should be split into it's own library as it's useful in it's own right.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Packager progress]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[The packager project has made some good progress in recent days. It has now managed to install some sample packages and work on an application to control the preferences needed is well underway. Work will start on the GUI app to maintain the pacakge system later today.<br>
What is needed is more people to look at the code, find bugs and contribute more features!]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Incubator Wiki now available]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[In order to provide a <em>whiteboard</em> environment for discussion and development of the ideas in the incubator we've added a new Wiki!<br>
In order to post changes you'll need to login using your BeClan userid and password, though anyone can read the entries. This has been done in an attempt to keep a form of order and prevent the abuse that sometimes occurs on other wiki's.<br>
This also allows any registered user to start a new incubator topic. Hopefully it will prove useful and allow the ideas to develop into applications!<br>
To visit the new pages simply follow the Incubator link as bfore :)]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[RSS Project starts...]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[Following the introduction of the aggregator service and the interest that has been shown in it, BeClan is happy to announce that we're starting a project to create the tools to use RSS effectively on BeOS/Zeta. We're glad that Massimiliano Origgi has agreed to lead the project and he's already started looking at code!<br>
We don't have the subversion repository open yet or the mailing lists ready for subscribers, but they should be available within a few days. If you're interested in helping please drop by the <a href="projects.php">Projects</a> page for the most up to date information.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[New BeOS Webring...]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[Webrings may be an old idea, but there are still  a large number around. Hadn't seen this one and it looks like it's only recently been setup, so might well be worth supporting! Go have a look at <a href="http://t.webring.com/hub?ring=thenewbeoswebrin">http://t.webring.com/hub?ring=thenewbeoswebrin</a>]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Aggregator starts]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[In an attempt to allow us to keep up with the news and views around about BeOS we've opened a new section that is still under going development and in need of some work, but might prove useful. It's reasonably self explanatory, so why not have a look? <a href="http://www.beclan.org/aggregator">http://www.beclan.org/aggregator</a> is the URL you'll need. As soon as it's got a little more stable and some polish has been added we'll add itt o the menu bars!]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Server Problems]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[As some of you may have noticed this site was off line for a while due to problems with the server it's hosted on. It's hoped that a replacement CPU will stop these problems from recurring!]]></description>
