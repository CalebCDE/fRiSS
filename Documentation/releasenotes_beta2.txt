FRISS DOCUMENTATION

friss Ver. beta2

This version is considered unstable. I need feedback on reproduceable crashs.
I am not responsible for any problems caused by a crashed Tracker. Don't say
I did not warn you ;-)

Known Issues:
	- Occasional crash after adding a new feed.
	- BeOS R5: displays a color matrix instead of sliders
		Workaround: Update to R5.0.3
	- BeOS R5: shows "Could not open Browser" despite it was opened correctly
		Workaround: Update to R5.0.3
	- Zeta: beta2 was not tested on Zeta. But since beta1 ran quite well on Zeta,
		I do not expect much errors. Please send in reports!

Not supported feeds:
	- Heise Newsticker. Their server seems not like the http-request or whatever.
	- TheBeosJournal RSS. Not using standard rss elements, but they offer rdf
		aswell so take that instead.
	- BeZip.de. For unknown reason, it won't send the file.

Please contact me for feature requests and bug reports:
